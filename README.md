# Security Project Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Security project. This document provides an overview of the project and explains how to use Terragrunt to manage the infrastructure for development, production, and testing environments. Additionally, it covers the use of Precommit and Makefile to simplify infrastructure management.

## 1. Project Overview

The Security project aims to build a robust security platform that leverages modern technologies and innovations. The infrastructure is managed using Terragrunt, a thin wrapper around Terraform that simplifies the management of multiple Terraform configurations.

## 2. Terragrunt Setup

To get started with Terragrunt, follow these steps:

1. Install Terragrunt by referring to the official Terragrunt documentation.
2. Clone the Security project repository.
3. Set up the necessary backend configuration for your infrastructure, such as AWS S3 bucket or Azure Blob Storage.
4. Configure Terragrunt to use the appropriate backend configuration and credentials.

## 3. Infrastructure Management

The Security project has separate infrastructure configurations for the development, production, and testing environments. Terragrunt allows for easy management of these environments using the concept of "Terragrunt modules."

### 3.1 Development Environment

To manage the infrastructure for the development environment, navigate to the `dev` directory within the project repository. This directory contains the Terragrunt module specific to the development environment.

Use the following Terragrunt commands to manage the development environment:

- `terragrunt init`: Initializes the Terraform backend and downloads the necessary provider plugins.
- `terragrunt plan`: Generates an execution plan for the infrastructure changes.
- `terragrunt apply`: Applies the infrastructure changes to the development environment.
- `terragrunt destroy`: Destroys the infrastructure for the development environment.

### 3.2 Production Environment

Similarly, to manage the infrastructure for the production environment, navigate to the `prod` directory. This directory contains the Terragrunt module specific to the production environment.

Use the same Terragrunt commands mentioned in the development environment section, such as `terragrunt init`, `terragrunt plan`, `terragrunt apply`, and `terragrunt destroy`, to manage the production environment infrastructure.

### 3.3 Testing Environment

The testing environment infrastructure is managed within the `test` directory. It follows the same Terragrunt module structure as the development and production environments.

Use the Terragrunt commands mentioned earlier to manage the infrastructure for the testing environment.

## 4. Precommit Integration

The Security project utilizes Precommit, a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. Precommit helps enforce coding standards, run tests, and perform other checks before committing code changes.

To set up Precommit, follow these steps:

1. Install Precommit by referring to the official Precommit documentation.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run `pre-commit install` to install the pre-commit hooks defined in the project repository.

Precommit will now run automatically before each commit, ensuring that your code meets the defined standards.

## 5. Makefile Usage

A Makefile is provided in the Security project to simplify common tasks related to infrastructure management. The Makefile includes targets for running Terragrunt commands, running tests, and other useful operations.

To use the Makefile, navigate to the project's root.

directory and run `make <target>`, replacing `<target>` with the desired Makefile target. For example, you can use `make init-dev` to initialize the development environment infrastructure.

Refer to the Makefile in the project repository for a complete list of available targets and their descriptions.

## Conclusion

This documentation provided an overview of the Security project and explained how to use Terragrunt for managing infrastructure in the development, production, and testing environments. It also covered the integration of Precommit for enforcing coding standards and the usage of the provided Makefile for simplifying common tasks.

For more detailed information, refer to the relevant sections and consult the project's documentation and source code.
